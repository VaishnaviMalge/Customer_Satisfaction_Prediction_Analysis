# Customer Satisfaction Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **customer satisfaction** using available customer data. The goal is to identify patterns and insights that can help improve customer experience and inform business decisions.

The analysis includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and initial modeling attempts**. Both regression and classification approaches were explored to predict customer satisfaction levels.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing and inconsistent data  
- Performed data cleaning and transformations for better model readiness  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand feature distributions, correlations, and relationships with the target variable  

## Modeling Approach
1. **Regression Modeling** – Attempted to predict satisfaction as a continuous variable  
2. **Classification Modeling** – Transformed satisfaction into **multiclass categories** and also experimented with **grouped target classes**  
3. **Findings**  
   - Significant **overlap** observed between the satisfaction categories  
   - Current features are insufficient to clearly separate classes for predictive modeling  

## Key Insights
- Existing data provides a starting point, but model performance is limited due to **overlapping satisfaction levels**  
- More **informative features** are needed for improved prediction  

## Future Improvements
- **Leverage text-based features** such as ticket descriptions  
- Apply **NLP techniques** (e.g., embeddings, sentiment analysis) to extract meaningful insights from text  
- Explore **feature engineering** to combine numerical, categorical, and textual data for better model performance   

## Conclusion
This project establishes a workflow for **customer satisfaction analysis**, including preprocessing, EDA, and initial modeling. The analysis highlights the need for richer features, especially from textual data, to build more accurate and actionable predictive models.
